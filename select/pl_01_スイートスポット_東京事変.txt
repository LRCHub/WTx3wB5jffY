If I lose my voice
You'll be the one reason
Without you here
Only echoes will ring
My song glides
On a wind free and flowing
Keep it nice
Keep it natural
You always know my sweet spot
You conjure up my voice
from down deep inside
And all I know is
you play me right
I just want you to touch me
No harm is ever done
by these things
And if you go away
I'll never feel like breathing
If you choose to leave
You'll leave in the season
My song's been sung
Only echoes still ring
One thing twice
Is too close to nothing
Make it nice
Make it sensual
You always know my sweet spot
You melt away the ice
from down deep inside
But no you don't know
it feels so right
I just want you to touch me
No joy is ever won
by these things
And if you go away
I'll never hear my heartbeat
There is no explaining
How we got this far
You never did promise anyone
So when I stop
and I think about it
I wonder is this really
Is this really what you wanted?
I always know your sweet spot
Well you could take a short cut
or take your time
'Cause only
I can read your signals right
You lead me where you want me
But I can never hold in
my weeping
'Cause when you go away
I hear only echoes ring …
I always know your sweet spot
Well you could take a short cut
or take your time
'Cause only
I can read your signals right
You lead me where you want me
But I can never hold in
my weeping
'Cause when you go away
I hear only echoes ring
